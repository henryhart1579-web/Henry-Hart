      <h2>About Ken & Udo </h2>
<h3>Ken was born into the Ekrika family, while Udo was born into the Okoroji family. Both grew up in large, loving households, surrounded by warmth and togetherness.Their paths first crossed in December 2023 during an online conversation on an IG community called Craftedinkindness . What started as friendly chats soon blossomed into genuine interest, deep connection, and eventually, love. After dating for eight months, they tied the knot on 24th August 2024—a day that marked the beginning of a beautiful journey together.Ken and Udo’s relationship is built on laughter, authenticity, consideration and mutual respect. Their shared interests—deep conversations, cooking, dancing, watching movies, hosting friends, taking walks, and especially their joint participation in Christian activities like the preaching work—continue to strengthen their bond.Together, they live in Akwa Ibom and have already built meaningful traditions: Friday date nights, regular family worship, and watching the JW broadcast together. In everyday life, they support one another through kind words, emotional check-ins, and acts of service that keep their love grounded and growing.As they celebrate their first wedding anniversary, their hearts are filled with gratitude to Jehovah, the originator of marriage, for the gift of love they share. They look forward to continuing to nurture that love, building a happy home, pursuing goals, and creating more cherished memories—while also savoring the joy of simply being together, here and now.</h3>
