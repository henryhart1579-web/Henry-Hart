       <h3>I would say Ken and Udo are two peas in a pod, which I think is essential to go on this kind of adventure together. Both of them don‚Äôt like wahala at all. They have similar disposition, and try to understand each other.At the beginning I was so happy yet a little anxious about how things would turn out, this first year has allayed all my anxiety. I‚Äôm still rooting for them and cheering them on, especially as I look forward to joining the ranks soon. I thank udo for giving me an extra brother, and Ken for being such a good one. It‚Äôs my most sincere wish that Jehovah continue to be the third cord of this union, and that the friendship peace and love and happiness continues to bloom for eternity. May the honeymoon season never end!!</h3>
